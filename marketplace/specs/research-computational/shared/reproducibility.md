# Reproducibility

A result should be traceable to the inputs, code, parameters, environment,
assumptions, and outputs that produced it. Keep the record in the form that
fits the work: an existing log, configuration, notebook, `result.md`, an
immutable source reference, or a short note is sufficient when it preserves
the needed facts.

## Temporary and retained work

Temporary outputs include debugging attempts, failed runs, quick probes, and
intermediate products that do not support a conclusion; keep them in a
clearly temporary location and remove them when they stop being useful.

Retain outputs used in a comparison, report, paper, handoff, baseline, or
result claim, with enough evidence to identify:

- the exact data source and version, including split, sampling, or selection
  rules and the variables consumed;
- the command or notebook, parameters, and seed or seed schedule;
- the code state, including relevant uncommitted changes;
- the environment, framework, and accelerator records when they can affect
  the result;
- metrics, figures, predictions, logs, negative or null observations,
  assumptions, and known limitations.

Evidence may be distributed across existing project files. Do not create a
per-run manifest or fill empty fields to follow a template. If a
configuration or script may change later, preserve the values and code
changes used by the run, or record a revision that identifies them; a
pointer to a mutable file alone is insufficient.

## Environment and randomness

Use the project's existing environment record, such as `uv.lock`, `renv.lock`,
a conda export, or a container digest. Record per-run state only when no
stable record exists or the environment can drift; never install unrecorded
dependencies into a shared environment. Record the seeds and RNG libraries
that matter, and note nondeterminism from hardware or parallelism when it
affects interpretation. Adjust randomness handling, such as deterministic
algorithms, only to answer an interpretation question or an observed
failure, without imposing it project-wide.

## Protocol changes and claims

For a retained comparison, keep question, method, data version, split,
preprocessing, metric definition, baseline, and claim scope identifiable; if
one changes, retain the earlier evidence and state what changed in the new
record. Describe what was evaluated, including outputs, evaluation group,
parameters, randomness, data version, code state, and limitations, before
claiming improvement, convergence, reproduction, or support for a
hypothesis. A successful command or task completion alone is not evidence
for a scientific claim.

External dashboards, notebooks, lab notes, and experiment trackers may
mirror the record; keep enough project-local evidence to recover the inputs
and decisions if those services change or disappear.

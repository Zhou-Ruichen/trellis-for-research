# Keep The Repository Maintainable

Research repositories become difficult to maintain when each task copies a
script, adds a wrapper, or leaves the replaced implementation beside the new
one. Prevent that accumulation while leaving exploration free to change.

## Reuse Before Adding

Before adding durable code:

1. Search for an existing loader, transform, analysis routine, metric, plot, or
   helper that already owns the behavior.
2. Prefer a parameter, config, or documented command over a copied script.
3. Reuse an existing dependency or the standard library before adding a new
   dependency or local implementation.
4. Add only the smallest implementation the task still needs.

Extract shared code when repeated durable logic is already present. Do not add a
factory, registry, base class, plugin system, or config class for possible future
reuse.

## Keep Variants In Parameters

Use one implementation with explicit parameters:

```text
scripts/analyze.py
configs/baseline.yaml
configs/sensitivity.yaml
configs/without_filter.yaml
```

Do not accumulate source variants:

```text
scripts/analyze_v2.py
scripts/analyze_final.py
scripts/simulation_new.py
```

If the project does not use config files, preserve the parameterized command in
the run record.

Version labels are valid when the thing itself has a versioned identity and the
versions need to coexist: datasets, schemas, public interfaces, model releases,
or experiment protocols. `dataset_v1.json` and `dataset_v2.json` can therefore
be correct. A suffix is not a substitute for deciding which source file owns
the current implementation.

## Exploratory And Diagnostic Code

Exploratory notebook cells and scripts may stay direct and local even when
reused. Delete temporary instrumentation after it answers the question. Extract
logic only to simplify the current work or meet an explicit maintenance need.

## Replace Without Accumulating

When the current task replaces tracked code, remove the superseded implementation
after the replacement has been checked. Git history preserves it. Do not keep `_old`,
`_final`, backup directories, compatibility wrappers, duplicate tests, or source
versions without a current reason to coexist.

This rule does not authorize unrelated cleanup. Report suspected dead code that
the current task did not replace. Preserve retained outputs, data manifests,
configs referenced by results, and untracked files unless the user requests
their removal.

In the completion report, mention material files added or removed and the reason.

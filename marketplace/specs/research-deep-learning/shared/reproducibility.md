# Reproducibility

For a number that matters, keep the shortest record that lets someone rerun
the calculation: the input or data version, code revision, command or
notebook, parameters, relevant seed, and an environment pointer. Put the
number, units, and a short condition in the existing result file, notebook, or
lab record. Reuse the project's existing record instead of creating a new
per-run form.

Use an existing lockfile, container digest, environment note, or immutable
source reference when one exists. Record per-run environment details only when
the environment can drift and change the number. Record a seed only when
randomness affects the result.

Keep large data, logs, checkpoints, figures, predictions, and intermediate
files outside Git by default. Store a path, URL, object key, or checksum when
the file is needed to rerun or interpret the number. Keep a copy only when the
external location is not stable or the number cannot otherwise be checked.

If a later run changes the input, method, parameter, or metric, write the new
values beside the new number and keep the earlier number unchanged. Pair every
reported number with its conditions; command success is an execution detail.
